## Features

### Authentication & Authorization
- Email/password sign-up and sign-in with session-based cookies
- Three roles: **Admin**, **Teacher**, **Student**
- Role-based middleware protecting all API routes
- **Unapproved teachers** (email not verified) are treated as students until an admin verifies them — role is automatically upgraded on next request
- CSRF protection via Better Auth trusted origins

### Department Management
- Full CRUD for academic departments
- Search and pagination support

### Subject Management
- Full CRUD for subjects linked to departments
- Filter by department, search by name/code

### Class Management
- Full CRUD for classes linked to subjects and teachers
- Class schedules (day, start/end time) stored as JSON
- Banner image support via Cloudinary
- Unique invite codes per class
- Capacity tracking and status management (active / inactive / archived)

### Enrollment System
- Admins and class teachers can enroll/remove students
- Students request to join via **Join Requests**
- Teachers and admins can approve or reject join requests
- Prevents duplicate enrollments and requests

### Dashboard & Analytics
- **Admin**: total users/classes/departments, enrollment trends, classes by department, capacity status, user distribution, recent activity
- **Teacher**: own class stats, enrolled students, pending join requests
- **Student**: enrolled classes, pending requests

### Security
- Arcjet Shield (SQL injection, XSS protection) — DRY_RUN in dev, LIVE in production
- Arcjet Bot Detection — blocks automated requests in production
- Per-role sliding window rate limiting (admin: 200/min, teacher/student: 120/min, guest: 30/min)
- CORS restricted to frontend origin + Vercel preview deployments

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** v18+
- **PostgreSQL** database (or a [Neon](https://neon.tech) account for serverless)
- **Arcjet** account for a site key ([arcjet.com](https://arcjet.com))

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd classroom-backend
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host/dbname?sslmode=require"

# Auth
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET="your-secret-key-min-32-chars"
BETTER_AUTH_BASE_URL="http://localhost:8000"

# Frontend origin (for CORS & trusted origins)
FRONTEND_URL="http://localhost:5173"

# Security
ARCJET_KEY="ajkey_your_arcjet_site_key"

# Optional
NODE_ENV="development"
```

### 4. Run database migrations

```bash
npm run db:generate
npm run db:migrate
```

### 5. Start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The server starts at **http://localhost:8000**.

### 6. Promote a user to admin

After signing up through the frontend, promote a user to admin:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/promote-admin.ts admin@example.com
```

## Production Deployment (Railway)

1. Push to your GitHub repo
2. Connect the repo to [Railway](https://railway.app)
3. Set environment variables in Railway dashboard:
   - `DATABASE_URL`
   - `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`
   - `BETTER_AUTH_BASE_URL` — your Railway public URL (e.g. `https://your-app.up.railway.app`)
   - `FRONTEND_URL` — your Vercel frontend URL (e.g. `https://your-app.vercel.app`)
   - `ARCJET_KEY`
   - `NODE_ENV=production`

4. Railway will run `npm run build` then `npm start` automatically.
